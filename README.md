RustOwl visualizes ownership movement and lifetimes of variables.
When you save Rust source code, it is analyzed, and the ownership and lifetimes of variables are visualized when you hover over a variable or function call.

RustOwl visualizes those by using underlines:

- 🟩 green: variable's actual lifetime
- 🟦 blue: immutable borrowing
- 🟪 purple: mutable borrowing
- 🟧 orange: value moved / function call
- 🟥 red: lifetime error
  - diff of lifetime between actual and expected, or
  - invalid overlapped lifetime of mutable and shared (immutable) references

Detailed usage is described [here](docs/usage.md).

Currently, we offer VSCode extension, Neovim plugin and Emacs package.
For these editors, move the text cursor over the variable or function call you want to inspect and wait for 2 seconds to visualize the information.
We implemented LSP server with an extended protocol.
So, RustOwl can be used easily from other editor.

## Support

If you're looking for support, please consider checking all issues, existing discussions, and [starting a discussion](https://github.com/cordx56/rustowl/discussions/new?category=q-a) first!

Also, you can reach out to us on the Discord server provided above.

## Quick Start

Here we describe how to start using RustOwl with VS Code.

### Prerequisite

- `cargo` installed
  - You can install `cargo` using `rustup` from [this link](https://rustup.rs/).
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed

We tested this guide on macOS Sequoia 15.3.2 on arm64 architecture with VS Code 1.99.3 and `cargo` 1.89.0.

### VS Code

You can install VS Code extension from [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cordx56.rustowl-vscode).
RustOwl will be installed automatically when the extension is activated.

### Vscodium

You can install Vscodium extension from [this link](https://open-vsx.org/extension/cordx56/rustowl-vscode).
RustOwl will be installed automatically when the extension is activated.

After installation, the extension will automatically run RustOwl when you save any Rust program in cargo workspace.
The initial analysis may take some time, but from the second run onward, compile caching is used to reduce the analysis time.

## Other editor support

We support Neovim and Emacs.
You have to [install RustOwl](docs/installation.md) before using RustOwl with other editors.

You can also create your own LSP client.
If you would like to implement a client, please refer to the [The RustOwl LSP specification](docs/lsp-spec.md).

### Neovim

Minimal setup with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  'cordx56/rustowl',
  version = '*', -- Latest stable version
  build = 'cargo binstall rustowl',
  lazy = false, -- This plugin is already lazy
  opts = {},
}
```

For comprehensive configuration options including custom highlight colors, see the [Neovim Configuration Guide](docs/neovim-configuration.md).

<details>
<summary>Recommended configuration: <b>Click to expand</b></summary>

```lua
{
  'cordx56/rustowl',
  version = '*', -- Latest stable version
  build = 'cargo binstall rustowl',
  lazy = false, -- This plugin is already lazy
  opts = {
    client = {
      on_attach = function(_, buffer)
        vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>o', function()
          require('rustowl').toggle(buffer)
        end, { buffer = buffer, desc = 'Toggle RustOwl' })
      end
    },
  },
}
```

</details>

Default options:

```lua
{
  auto_attach = true, -- Auto attach the RustOwl LSP client when opening a Rust file
  auto_enable = false, -- Enable RustOwl immediately when attaching the LSP client
  idle_time = 500, -- Time in milliseconds to hover with the cursor before triggering RustOwl
  client = {}, -- LSP client configuration that gets passed to `vim.lsp.start`
  highlight_style = 'undercurl', -- You can also use 'underline'
  colors = { -- Customize highlight colors (hex colors)
    lifetime = '#00cc00',   -- 🟩 green: variable's actual lifetime
    imm_borrow = '#0000cc', -- 🟦 blue: immutable borrowing
    mut_borrow = '#cc00cc', -- 🟪 purple: mutable borrowing
    move = '#cccc00',       -- 🟧 orange: value moved
    call = '#cccc00',       -- 🟧 orange: function call
    outlive = '#cc0000',    -- 🟥 red: lifetime error
  },
}
```

#### Customizing Highlight Colors

You can customize the colors used for different highlight types by setting the `colors` option in your configuration:

```lua
{
  'cordx56/rustowl',
  version = '*',
  build = 'cargo binstall rustowl',
  lazy = false,
  opts = {
    colors = {
      lifetime = '#32cd32',   -- Lime green for lifetimes
      imm_borrow = '#4169e1', -- Royal blue for immutable borrows
      mut_borrow = '#ff69b4', -- Hot pink for mutable borrows
      move = '#ffa500',       -- Orange for moves
      call = '#ffd700',       -- Gold for function calls
      outlive = '#dc143c',    -- Crimson for lifetime errors
    },
  },
}
```

Each color should be specified as a hex color string (e.g., `'#ff0000'` for red).

When opening a Rust file, the Neovim plugin creates the `Rustowl` user command:

```vim
:Rustowl {subcommand}
```

where `{subcommand}` can be one of:

- `start_client`: Start the rustowl LSP client.
- `stop_client`: Stop the rustowl LSP client.
- `restart_client`: Restart the rustowl LSP client.
- `enable`: Enable rustowl highlights.
- `disable`: Disable rustowl highlights.
- `toggle`: Toggle rustowl highlights.

### Emacs

Elpaca example:

```elisp
(elpaca
  (rustowl
    :host github
    :repo "cordx56/rustowl"))
```

Then use-package:

```elisp
(use-package rustowl
  :after lsp-mode)
```

You have to install RustOwl LSP server manually.

### RustRover / IntelliJ IDEs

There is a [third-party repository](https://github.com/siketyan/intellij-rustowl) that supports IntelliJ IDEs.
You have to install RustOwl LSP server manually.

### Sublime Text

There is a [third-party repository](https://github.com/CREAsTIVE/LSP-rustowl) that supports Sublime Text.

## Architecture / OS / package repositories

### [Cargo Binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall)

One of the easiest way to install RustOwl is using cargo-binstall.

```bash
cargo binstall rustowl
```

Toolchain is automatically Downloaded and unpacked.

### Windows

We have a winget package, install with:

```sh
winget install rustowl
```

### Archlinux

We have an AUR package. It downloads prebuilt binaries from release page. Run:

```sh
yay -S rustowl-bin
```

If you would like to build from that version instead:

```sh
yay -S rustowl
```

Replace `yay` with your AUR helper of choice.

We also have a git version, that builds from source:

```sh
yay -S rustowl-git
```

### Nix flake

There is a [third-party Nix flake repository](https://github.com/nix-community/rustowl-flake) in the Nix community.

### GitHub Release

Download only `rustowl` executable from [release page](https://github.com/cordx56/rustowl/releases/latest) and place it into the place you desire.
Toolchain is automatically Downloaded and unpacked.

### Docker

You can run `rustowl` using the pre-built Docker image from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

1. Pull the latest stable image

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/cordx56/rustowl:latest
```

Or pull a specific version:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/cordx56/rustowl:v0.3.4
```

2. Run the image

```sh
docker run --rm -v /path/to/project:/app ghcr.io/cordx56/rustowl:latest
```

You can also pass command-line arguments as needed:

```sh
docker run --rm /path/to/project:/app ghcr.io/cordx56/rustowl:latest --help
```

3. (Optional) Use as a CLI

To use `rustowl` as if it were installed on your system, you can create a shell alias:

```sh
alias rustowl='docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/cordx56/rustowl:latest'
```

Now you can run `rustowl` from your terminal like a regular command.

## Build manually

There is a [build guide](docs/build.md) to build RustOwl or extensions.

## Note

In this tool, due to the limitations of VS Code's decoration specifications, characters with descenders, such as g or parentheses, may occasionally not display underlines properly.
Additionally, we observed that the `println!` macro sometimes produces extra output, though this does not affect usability in any significant way.
